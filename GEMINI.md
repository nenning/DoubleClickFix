# Gemini Context File for DoubleClickFix

This document provides context for the Gemini CLI to understand the DoubleClickFix project.

## Project Overview

DoubleClickFix is a C# .NET Windows Forms application designed to intercept and filter erroneous mouse double-clicks. It is distributed through the Microsoft Store as an MSIX package. The project uses low-level mouse hooks to function.

## Project Structure

The solution (`DoubleClickFix.sln`) contains the following key projects:

-   **`DoubleClickFix/`**: The main Windows Forms application project (`.csproj`). This contains the core logic for the mouse hook and the user interface.
-   **`DoubleClickFix.Package/`**: A Windows Application Packaging Project (`.wapproj`) used to build the MSIX package for distribution via the Microsoft Store.
-   **`DoubleClickFix.Tests/`**: A unit testing project for the main application.

## Build and Packaging

The application is built using MSBuild or Visual Studio.

-   **Building the Application**: The main application can be built by targeting the `DoubleClickFix.csproj` file.
-   **Building the Store Package**: To create the distributable package for the Microsoft Store, the `DoubleClickFix.Package.wapproj` project must be built.

### Platform Architecture

The project is configured to build for `x86` architecture due to troubles with the Microsoft Store. The `DoubleClickFix.Package.wapproj` is configured to create an `AppxBundle`.

### Key Build Commands

While you can build through the Visual Studio UI, you can also use the command line:

-   **Build the solution (Release configuration):**
    ```bash
    msbuild DoubleClickFix.sln /p:Configuration=Release
    ```
-   **Create the MSIX package bundle:**
    ```bash
    msbuild DoubleClickFix.Package/DoubleClickFix.Package.wapproj /p:Configuration=Release /p:AppxBundle=Always /p:AppxBundlePlatforms="x86|x64|arm64"
    ```

## Native Dependencies

The application uses P/Invoke to call native Windows APIs for the low-level mouse hook (`user32.dll`, `kernel32.dll`). The relevant files are:
- `DoubleClickFix/NativeMethods.cs`
- `DoubleClickFix/INativeMethods.cs`
- `DoubleClickFix/MouseHook.cs`

The use of `IntPtr` ensures that the native calls are compatible across different system architectures.
